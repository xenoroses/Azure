Create a Maven Project, Understanding the POM File, Dependency Management and 
Plugins. 

1. Prerequisites required 
● Java JDK (version 21 preferable) must be installed. 
● Confirm Java installation by typing the below command in command prompt: 
java -version 

Step 1: Download and install Maven from: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi 
● Install Binary Zip file only. ->apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.zip 
❌ Do NOT Download: 
● src.zip – contains source code (not needed for installation) 
● .tar.gz – intended for Linux/Unix systems 

Step 2 : Add Maven to your system path: 
● MAVEN_HOME ➝ Path to Maven folder 
● Add MAVEN_HOME/bin to the PATH 
After Downloading: 

1. Extract the zip file to a location like: 
C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\apache-maven-3.9.6 

2. Set environment variables using setx (as explained below) 

3. Open Command Prompt (Run as Administrator) and execute the following :  
> setx MAVEN_HOME "C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\apache-maven-3.9.6" /M 
> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\apache-maven-3.9.6\bin" /M 

4. Restart 
your 
Command -> Check whether is Maven is properly installed  

5. Open Command Prompt and execute the following :  
>    mvn -v 
Prompt 
and 
check: 

Step 3: Create a Maven Project -> Type the following in the cmd prompt 
> mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=demo-project 
DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false 
OR -> After the Execution the above cmd on the command prompt, the project structure looks like 
below. 

1.  
Step 4: Add a Dependency -> Step 4 : Go to the demo-project folder and understand the usage of pom.xml file. -> To use a library, add its dependency in the <dependencies> block,  
Example: Add Gson (for JSON parsing): -> Add the below dependency code section to the pom.xml file. 
<dependency> 
<groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId> 
<artifactId>gson</artifactId> 
<version>2.10.1</version> 
</dependency> -> In the same way you can add any number of dependencies required for your application. 

Step 5: Building Maven Project -> Change the directory to demo-project : 
> cd demo-project 
> mvn compile  
> mvn test         
> mvn package        

Step 6: Run the JAR File -> If you have a main() method in App.java, run the JAR like this: 
java -cp target/demo-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
Note : The above steps is to run a Java Application using Maven.
